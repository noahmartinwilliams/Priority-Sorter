What is this?
=============

This is a program I've been wanting to write for quite some time now.
Often in engineering you might have a number of criteria you want to meet for a project, but some
criteria will be more important than others and you might want to sort through them from most important to least important.

That's what this program does. It takes the name of an input file as the first argument and the output file as the second
argument, and it will do a quicksort where it interactively asks you to compare each line.
It also demonstrates how to use unsafePerformIO in Haskell so that you can cheat and be less than perfectly functional.
